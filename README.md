# Fault-Management
This repository contains the Solar Panel Dataset and Python code for detecting and classifying faults in solar panels using the Explainable Ensemble Fault Classifier (EEFC). The aim is to enable timely fault identification, which is crucial for optimizing hydrogen production and supporting sustainable, green energy solutions.
